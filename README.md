Welcome to Denver BreweryFinder!

Denver BreweryFinder is an interactive web application created in December 2023 that allows users to discover new breweries located throughout the Denver area. It utilizes the public API Open Brewery DB. One of the best things about this API is that it does not require an API key for authorization, which can make it more accessible  for those learning how to code.

The Denver BreweryFinder provides users with a useful demonstration of several JavaScript coding languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and concepts such as Event Listeners (click event, keydown event, mouseover event), array iteration (forEach()),  and DOM/server communication. 

When users first open up the application they will see an image of a beer bottle or can in the middle of the page, with a left and right arrow to the side of that image.  Clicking either one of the arrows will allow the user to scroll through a collection of new images with information about a unique Denver brewery. The displayed information includes the brewery (name) and (address).  There are also images of each brewery shown individually at the top of the page which will ***CANNOT REDIRECT*** when clicked on.

Users with questions, comments, or concerns about Denver BreweryFinder may visit Open BreweryDB to view the API or may contact the creators listed below for more information.

Denver BreweryFinder was created by Flatiron School students Andrew Owens and Adrian Barba for their Phase-1 Project assignment.
