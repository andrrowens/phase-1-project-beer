# Welcome to Denver BreweryFinder!
**Denver BreweryFinder** is an interactive web application created in December 2022 that allows users to discover new breweries located throughout the Denver area. It utilizes the public API [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org). One of the best things about this API is that it does not require an API key for authorization, which can make it more accessible for those learning how to code.
**Denver BreweryFinder** provides users with a useful demonstration of several JavaScript coding languages such as _JavaScript_, _HTML_, and _CSS_ and concepts such as Event Listeners (_click event_, _keydown event_, _mouseover event_), _array iteration_ (_forEach()_), and _DOM/server communication_.
When users first open up the application they will see an image of a beer bottle or can in the middle of the page, with a left and right arrow to the side of that image. Clicking either one of the arrows will allow the user to scroll through a collection of new images with the ability to click on any of the images above for more information about a unique Denver brewery. The displayed information includes the brewery name and address. There are also images of each brewery shown individually at the top of the page which will take the user to the brewery's website when clicked on.
